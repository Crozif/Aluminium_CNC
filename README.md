# Budget CNC cutting alluminium

This cnc router is my third itteration, the two previous versions was only able to cut wood and plastic and barely engraving aluminum.
This version is capable of cutting any soft metal (aluminuim, copper, brass even silver) easly.
The total cost including the salvaged part from my previous CNC is around 300€, if you want to replicate the project the cost can change depending of what materials you have availlable.

The design is based on 45*45mm aluminium extrusions that i've recovered from the waste disposal. It is powered by 4 Nema 17 stepper motors from my previous CNC and an arduino cnc shield V3.

In addition you need to find something to build the base on like aluminium extrusion, if you can found from second hand it can cost something like 40€ otherwise it's more like 80€. Even if it looks stiff 2020 extrusion from 3D printer can bend en vibrate with this type of machine so I'll recommand to use at least 30mm thick aluminuim extrusion.
You will also need 8mm thick aluminium plate about 200*200mm again if you can found some from second hand it can be really cheap.

Some more commun supply are also needed like heat shrink tube, solder, wires (I use wires from old RJ45 cable it can handle something like 5A without a problem, its free nd easly accessible).

A lots of tools are needed to work properly:

- Soldering iron
- Drill press
- Caliper
- Dial indicator
- Heat gun
- A good square rule
- Handed metal saw 
- Metal band saw (if your alumiun extrusions needed to be with a perfect 90° angle)
- Hand drill
- Center punch
- Marker for metal
- Hammer, clamps, screw drivers others hand tools
